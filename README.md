\# Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data



This is a project I completed for my bachelors thesis, I utilised bespoke Python code implementing the PyTorch open-source machine learning library to achieve in-depth data analysis on a large medical dataset.



The dataset has been pruned from this repository due to GitHub file size restraints, and can be found \[here](https://www.link.to/dataset) instead.



While this project constituted 43 commits originally, those could not preserved in the transfer from GitLab because GitHub does not support the large files of the dataset that were part of many of those commits. This commit history can instead be viewed by the curious at \[the original host location](https://gitlab.com/JackAuty/comp3931-individual-project/-/commits/master?ref\_type=HEADS).
